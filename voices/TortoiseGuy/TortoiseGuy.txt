There were once three billy goats who lived in a meadow at the foot of a mountain, and their last name was Gruff. There was the big billy goat Gruff, the middle-sized billy goat Gruff, and the little billy goat Gruff. There was still left to him a little house in the country, and to this, when everything else in the world had been sold, he retired.
